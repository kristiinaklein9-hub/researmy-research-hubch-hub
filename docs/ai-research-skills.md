# AI research skills index

research-hub ships a small set of skills that an AI assistant can load to
operate a research workspace. This page is the directory: which skill to
use when, what it reads, what it writes, and what it deliberately doesn't
cover.

## Stages of a research project

| Stage | What it is | Owner | Skill(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Discover sources | Find papers / data | research-hub | `research-hub`, `literature-triage-matrix` |
| 2. Ingest + tag | Pull into Zotero / Obsidian | research-hub | `research-hub`, `zotero-library-curator` |
| **2.5. Decide the topic** | 3-gate go/no-go on a candidate topic; produces a decision dossier | shared | `gap-to-topic` (emits `.gaps.yml` for the chosen candidate — Stage 3a wiring lands in v0.3.12) |
| **3a. Frame the problem** | Sharpen RQ; design study | **YOU** (creative) | `research-design-helper` (Socratic guide; **v0.3.12+** will pre-fill from `gap-to-topic`'s `.gaps.yml` if present) |
| **3b. Plan artifacts** | Manifest + experiment matrix | mechanical | `research-context-compressor`, `research-project-orienter` |
| 4. Design & build the model | Implement | YOU + cross-cutting tools | (see Cross-cutting tools below) |
| 5. Run experiments | Execute | YOU | (cross-cutting) |
| 6. Synthesize | Brief / claims | research-hub | `paper-memory-builder`, `notebooklm-brief-verifier` |
| 7. Write & revise | Manuscript | external skill | `academic-writing-skills` |
| 8. Submission ops | Cover letter, response | mixed | external |

> **Stage 3a is intentionally human work.** AI skills cannot invent your
> research question — `research-context-compressor` will leave
> `research_question:` empty and add the gap to `.research/open_questions.md`
> rather than guess. The `research-design-helper` skill (v0.68) guides you
> through 5 Socratic segments to sharpen the question yourself; it does not
> write the answer for you.

## Cross-cutting tools (used at every stage)

These three skills are NOT stage-bound. They route work by **task character**
(token-heavy / long-context / CJK / mechanical bulk), not by pipeline
position:

- `research-hub-multi-ai` — when to keep work in the primary AI vs hand
  it to Codex (heavy code, batch edits) or Gemini (long CJK prose,
  cross-file synthesis).
- `codex-delegate` (external skill) — Codex CLI handoff when Claude
  would otherwise spend many turns on mechanical scaffolding.
- `gemini-delegate` (external skill) — Gemini CLI handoff for >50k-token
  context reads or zh-TW content.

Examples per stage where delegation matters:

- **Stage 1**: Gemini summarizes a 200-page systematic review you found.
- **Stage 2**: Codex batch-rewrites frontmatter on 100 cluster notes.
- **Stage 3a**: keep in primary AI (creative thinking, low token cost).
- **Stage 6**: Gemini drafts a long zh-TW NotebookLM brief preface.
- **Stage 8**: Gemini writes the zh-TW cover letter; Codex builds the
  reviewer-response table.

The `research-hub-multi-ai` SKILL.md lists the routing rules.

## When to use which skill

| Situation | Skill | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| New repo, AI asked to "understand this project" | `research-context-compressor` then `research-project-orienter` | one-time setup |
| Project already has `.research/` manifests, just need orientation | `research-project-orienter` | seconds |
| Comparing 5–30 papers for a literature review | `literature-triage-matrix` | minutes |
| Preparing a manuscript for AI-assisted writing/revision | `paper-memory-builder` | minutes |
| Just downloaded a NotebookLM brief, want to verify it | `notebooklm-brief-verifier` | minutes |
| Want a Zotero audit / dedupe / tag hygiene plan (no writes) | `zotero-library-curator` | minutes |
| Deciding whether a research gap is worth pursuing (open / a contribution / feasible) | `gap-to-topic` | one session |
| Starting a new study, want to sharpen the RQ + design before coding | `research-design-helper` | one session |
| General research workflow (search → ingest → organize) | `research-hub` (the original CLI-operating skill) | continuous |
| Multi-AI handoff (Claude ↔ Codex ↔ Gemini) | `research-hub-multi-ai` | as needed |

## All packaged skills

### `research-hub`
The CLI-operating skill — drives `research-hub auto`, `import-folder`,
`zotero backfill`, `notebooklm bundle/upload/generate/download`, `dashboard`,
and maintenance commands. **Reads**: user intent + Zotero/Obsidian/NotebookLM
state. **Writes**: through the CLI; no direct file output.

Trigger phrases: "find papers about X", "ingest this folder", "build a
notebook for cluster X", "show me the dashboard".

### `research-hub-multi-ai`
Multi-AI delegation playbook. Tells Claude when to hand a task to Codex
(token-heavy code, batch edits) or Gemini (long CJK prose, summaries) and
how. **Reads**: nothing from disk. **Writes**: nothing.

Trigger phrases: "delegate this to Codex/Gemini", "this is a heavy task",
"who should write this section?".

### `research-context-compressor` (v0.66)
Inspects the repository and produces `.research/project_manifest.yml`,
`.research/experiment_matrix.yml`, `.research/data_dictionary.yml`. Future
sessions read these instead of rescanning the repo.

**Reads**: README, top-level docs, scripts, notebooks, data dirs.
**Writes**: `.research/*.yml` and an entry in `.research/run_log.md`.

Trigger phrases: "compress this project context for future agents",
"create a research manifest", "save the project context".

See: [research-workspace-manifest.md](research-workspace-manifest.md) for
the full schema.

### `research-project-orienter` (v0.66)
Reads the `.research/` manifests and produces a single orientation memo:
research question, datasets, current stage, key entrypoints, open
questions, where the live work is happening.

**Reads**: `.research/project_manifest.yml` and siblings.
**Writes**: nothing by default; the orientation memo lives in the
conversation.

Trigger phrases: "orient me in this project", "what is this repo about",
"build a context map for this paper".

### `literature-triage-matrix` (v0.66)
Turns a list of papers (Zotero collection, Obsidian cluster, manual list)
into a comparison matrix instead of generic per-paper summaries. Output is
a Markdown table at `.research/literature_matrix.md`.

**Reads**: Zotero metadata via local API or web API; Obsidian paper notes
under `raw/<cluster>/`; research-hub cluster manifests; NotebookLM
downloaded briefs if present.
**Writes**: `.research/literature_matrix.md`.

Trigger phrases: "make a literature matrix", "compare these papers by
method/data/limitations", "help me decide which papers are central".

### `paper-memory-builder` (v0.66)
Bridge between research-hub and `academic-writing-skills`. Reads the
manuscript (or Obsidian paper folder) plus relevant figures and
emits structured `.paper/claims.yml` and `.paper/figures.yml` so the
writing skill can do its work without re-reading the whole paper.

**Reads**: manuscript files; figure files; existing Obsidian notes about
the paper.
**Writes**: `.paper/claims.yml`, `.paper/figures.yml`.

Trigger phrases: "build paper memory for this manuscript", "extract the
claims and supporting evidence", "prepare this paper for AI-assisted
writing".

### `notebooklm-brief-verifier` (v0.66)
After `research-hub notebooklm download` produces a brief, this skill
verifies the brief faithfully reflects the source bundle research-hub
uploaded. Catches missed sources and unsupported claims.

**Reads**: `research-hub` bundle manifest, downloaded NotebookLM brief,
underlying source files only when needed for spot-checks.
**Writes**: nothing on disk; returns a structured report in the conversation
listing source coverage, missing sources, unsupported claims, contradictions,
and recommended follow-up prompts.

Trigger phrases: "verify this NotebookLM brief", "does the brief miss
anything", "compare the downloaded notes to the cluster papers".

### `research-design-helper` (v0.68)
Stage 3a / front-of-Stage 4 helper. Domain-agnostic Socratic guide that
walks the user through 5 segments — research question sharpening,
expected mechanism, identifiability check, validation plan, risk
register — and saves the result to `.research/design_brief.md`.

Does NOT invent the research question or model design; like
`research-context-compressor`, it leaves blanks rather than guess.

**Reads**: `.research/project_manifest.yml`, optional `design_brief.md`
(refresh mode), optional `literature_matrix.md` (for prior-art context
during identifiability discussion).
**Writes**: `.research/design_brief.md`.

Trigger phrases: "frame this research question", "design my study",
"help me think through what model to build", "sharpen my hypothesis",
"walk me through the design".

### `gap-to-topic` (v0.3.11)
Sits between Stage 2 and Stage 3a. Turns a research area into a go/no-go
decision dossier for 1–N candidate thesis/proposal topics — a 3-gate
verdict (is the gap **open**? is it a **contribution**? is it
**feasible**?) with the evidence laid out so the researcher can verify
it. Deliberately stops short of "is it worth doing" — that call is
handed back to the researcher + advisor.

**Reads**: user intent (Socratic §0), `research-hub search --adversarial
--screen --json` results (§1), `.research/literature_matrix.md` (§1
step 2 output), optional `.research/claims.yml` for cross-link.
**Writes**: `.research/topic_dossier.md` + `.docx` (research-grade
Word memo via `scripts/dossier_to_docx.js`, v0.3.10+),
`.research/topic_dossier.bib`, `.research/topic_dossier.gaps.yml`,
`.research/literature_matrix.md`.

**Handoff to Stage 3a**: `.gaps.yml` is the machine-readable contract
that `research-design-helper` **will read in v0.3.12+** to pre-fill its
Socratic dialog (chosen candidate → segment 1 RQ; `open_questions[]` →
segment 5 risks). The schema (top-level `downstream_consumer:
research-design-helper` key as forward-compat hook) is documented in
`references/dossier-template.md` Schema reference section; the wire-up
itself ships in plugin v0.3.12 (Stage 2 → 3a integration PR).

Trigger phrases: "is this research gap worth pursuing", "help me pick
a thesis topic", "is this idea already taken", "find me a defensible
research gap", "vet this research idea before I commit".

### `zotero-library-curator` (v0.67)
Sits one layer above the standalone `zotero-skills` skill. Reads the
Zotero library, runs **audit + hygiene** checks (duplicate DOIs, items
missing required tags, cluster/collection mismatches, tag near-duplicates,
collection bloat), and emits a **preview-only plan**. For any actual
create/update/delete, it defers to `zotero-skills` or
`research-hub zotero backfill`.

**Reads**: research-hub cluster registry, Zotero library state via local
API, dedup index. **Writes**: nothing on disk by default; can save report
to `.research_hub/curator-<ts>.md` on request.

Trigger phrases: "audit my Zotero library", "find duplicate DOIs",
"propose a tag hygiene cleanup plan", "Zotero cleanup preview".

## What these skills deliberately don't cover

The boundary is important enough to repeat from the brief
(`docs/research-hub-research-skills-brief.md`):

- **Domain-specific model governance, audit traces, or coupling contracts** —
  those live in the model repositories, not in the public research-hub skill
  pack.
- **Manuscript editing without research-workspace context** — handled by
  the standalone `academic-writing-skills` skill.
- **Full Zotero CRUD** — handled by the standalone `zotero-skills` repo.
  research-hub's Zotero integration is the lightweight, pipeline-aware
  half (tags, notes, collection sync); deep CRUD (item-level edit, batch
  rename, tag merge) belongs elsewhere.

## Installation

All packaged skills install together:

```bash
research-hub install --platform claude-code
research-hub install --platform cursor
research-hub install --platform codex
research-hub install --platform gemini
```

Each platform gets every skill under its respective skills directory
(`~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, `~/.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`,
etc). `research-hub install --list` shows install status per platform.

## Combinations that work well

- **Cold start a new repo** — load `research-context-compressor`, then
  `research-project-orienter` in the same session. Compressor writes
  manifests, orienter immediately reads them and gives a memo.
- **Literature review** — load `research-context-compressor` first so
  the project knows its own scope, then `literature-triage-matrix` to
  pull in candidate papers and produce the matrix.
- **Pre-submission check** — load `paper-memory-builder` to extract
  claims, then call `academic-writing-skills` to do the audit / banned
  word / mechanism-for-every-result checks.
- **Post-NLM-run sanity check** — after `research-hub notebooklm
  generate brief && download brief`, load `notebooklm-brief-verifier`
  to confirm coverage before sharing the brief with collaborators.
