# Your first 10 minutes with research-hub

A guided tour for each of the 4 personas. Pick yours below and follow the matching path.

> Not sure which persona? See `docs/personas.md` for the full feature matrix. The TL;DR:
> - **Researcher** — PhD STEM, uses Zotero
> - **Humanities** — uses Zotero + works heavily with quotes / non-DOI sources
> - **Analyst** — industry researcher, no Zotero, imports PDFs
> - **Internal KM** — knowledge management for a lab / company, mixed file types

All 4 personas share the same dashboard, MCP server, crystal system, and cluster integrity tools. The dashboard auto-adapts vocabulary and hides irrelevant features per persona.

## If You Only Want To See It Work

Use this path before creating API keys or signing in to Google:

```bash
pip install research-hub-pipeline
research-hub dashboard --sample
```

Or create a local demo vault you can inspect in Obsidian:

```bash
research-hub init --sample
research-hub serve --dashboard
```

This skips Zotero, NotebookLM, and LLM CLI probes. It is the fastest
way to confirm the package installed correctly.

---

## 0 minutes: install

```bash
# Researcher / Humanities (need Zotero + NotebookLM)
pip install research-hub-pipeline[playwright,secrets]

# Analyst / Internal KM (no Zotero, work with local files)
pip install research-hub-pipeline[import,secrets]
```

`[secrets]` enables Zotero key encryption at rest (recommended for all personas that use Zotero). `[mcp]` is included by default for AI integration.

---

## 2 minutes: init

```bash
research-hub init --persona <researcher|humanities|analyst|internal>
```

Or run with no flag for an interactive 4-option prompt. You'll be asked for:

- **Vault path** (default: `~/knowledge-base/`) — where your data lives
- **Zotero API key + library ID** (researcher / humanities only)
- **Persona** if not provided via flag

After `init`:

```
~/knowledge-base/
├── raw/                       # paper notes (markdown), one folder per cluster
├── hub/                       # cluster overviews + crystals + structured memory
│   └── <cluster-slug>/
│       ├── 00_overview.md     # narrative summary
│       ├── crystals/          # pre-computed Q→A answers
│       └── memory.json        # entities, claims, methods
├── projects/                  # your draft markdown files
├── logs/                      # operation logs
└── .research_hub/             # config + cache
```

Run `research-hub where` any time to confirm paths.

## 5 minutes: first useful action (per persona)

For your first `auto` run, use `--no-nlm` until `research-hub doctor`
reports Zotero and the vault are healthy. This keeps browser automation
out of the debugging path.

### Researcher

```bash
# Add a paper by DOI or arXiv ID
research-hub add 10.48550/arxiv.2310.06770 --cluster llm-agents

# After 5+ papers in the cluster, generate AI answers
research-hub crystal emit --cluster llm-agents > prompt.md
# Feed prompt.md to a supported LLM CLI/chat, save response as crystals.json
research-hub crystal apply --cluster llm-agents --scored crystals.json
```

### Humanities

```bash
# Add a non-DOI source (URL, book) via Zotero first, then:
research-hub quote add my-source-slug --text "the quote text" --page 42 --note "your gloss"
research-hub compose-draft --cluster victorian-novels > draft.md
```

### Analyst

```bash
# Drop a folder of PDFs / markdown / DOCX
research-hub import-folder ~/Downloads/q4-research --cluster q4-analysis
research-hub serve --dashboard  # opens browser, see your topic + documents
```

### Internal KM

```bash
# Same as Analyst — mixed file types auto-handled
research-hub import-folder /shared/wiki-export --cluster product-launch
```

---

## 7 minutes: open the dashboard

```bash
research-hub serve --dashboard
# Visit http://127.0.0.1:8765/
```

Your persona's dashboard:

- **Researcher** sees: 6 tabs (Overview / Library / Briefings / Writing / Diagnostics / Manage), full vocabulary (Cluster, Crystal, Paper)
- **Humanities** sees: same 6 tabs, vocabulary renamed (Theme, Synthesis, Source)
- **Analyst** sees: 5 tabs (Diagnostics hidden), vocabulary renamed (Topic, AI Brief, Document), Bind-Zotero button hidden
- **Internal KM** sees: 5 tabs, vocabulary renamed (Project area, AI Brief, Document)

Side-by-side preview screenshots: `docs/images/dashboard-overview-{researcher,humanities,analyst,internal}.png`.

## 9 minutes: connect Claude Desktop (optional)

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "research-hub": {
      "command": "research-hub",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. You can now talk to your vault:

> "Claude, what's in my llm-agents cluster?"
> "Claude, generate crystals for the q4-analysis topic"
> "Claude, list orphan papers — anything that needs a home?"

60 MCP tools cover: paper ingest, cluster CRUD, labels, quotes, draft composition, citation graph, NotebookLM, crystal generation, fit-check, autofill, cluster memory, and cluster rebind workflows.

---

## 10 minutes: doctor

```bash
research-hub doctor
```

Catches 12+ common issues across config, vault structure, Zotero connectivity, cluster integrity, persona setup. Always the first thing to run when something feels wrong.

If you want NotebookLM in the loop, sign in after the local checks pass:

```bash
research-hub notebooklm login --auto-detect
```

Google may still show a new-device or phone challenge. Complete it in
the visible browser; research-hub saves the session after NotebookLM
loads.

## What's next

- Read `docs/personas.md` for the full per-persona feature matrix
- Read `docs/cluster-integrity.md` if your vault has orphan papers (post-import or migrated from a previous tool — `research-hub clusters rebind` proposes assignments)
- Read `docs/anti-rag.md` for why crystals beat RAG for token cost + answer quality
- Read `docs/example-claude-mcp-flow.md` for a worked example: ingest → crystallize → query
- Read `UPGRADE.md` if you're migrating from a pre-v0.30 vault
