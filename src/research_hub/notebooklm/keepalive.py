"""Idle keepalive for NotebookLM sessions.

Periodically refreshes the short-lived freshness cookies (``__Secure-1PSIDTS``
/ ``__Secure-3PSIDTS``) so Google does not revoke an idle session. Google's
PSIDTS cookies expire every ~3-4 hours; the long-lived ``SID``/``PSID``
cookies last ~1 year. If a minute-cadence keepalive actually rotates PSIDTS
ahead of expiry, the practical session lifetime is bounded by the
long-lived cookies, not the short ones.

Refresh contract
----------------
``refresh_and_persist_session`` (the primary API) calls the SDK's public
``fetch_tokens_with_domains`` — which actually fetches CSRF + session_id
tokens from the NotebookLM homepage as a side-effect of cookie rotation.
This is observable proof: if tokens come back, the cookies are good. The
older ``rotate_and_persist_session`` wrapper used the SDK's private
``_rotate_cookies`` poke which returned success without verifying that the
session was still alive — every "success" in the logs could have been a
no-op against a revoked session.

Honest scope note
-----------------
- ``refresh_and_persist_session`` makes one network call to Google. If the
  session is already revoked server-side it returns a ``RefreshResult`` with
  ``ok=False`` and an actionable reason; ``keepalive_once`` then returns
  non-zero so a scheduler can surface the failure.
- The Windows Scheduled Task registration (``--install-windows-task``) is
  gated behind an explicit ``--yes`` flag. Without ``--yes`` the exact
  ``schtasks`` command is only printed.
- The task runs via a console-script (if pip-installed) or a generated wrapper
  ``.cmd`` file (if running from a source checkout) to guarantee PYTHONPATH is
  set correctly. No elevated privileges (no /RL HIGHEST) are required.
- Google can still hard-expire long-lived SID/PSID cookies or revoke on a
  security event; keepalive does not defeat revocation. Combine with
  ``notebooklm login --auto-detect`` for re-auth when that happens.
