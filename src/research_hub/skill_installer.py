"""Install research-hub SKILL.md files into AI coding assistant directories.

v0.53 shipped a skill PACK (multiple SKILL.md files), not just one. v0.66
adds five workspace skills (research-context-compressor, project-orienter,
literature-triage-matrix, paper-memory-builder, notebooklm-brief-verifier)

Discovery is dynamic as of v0.66: the installer walks `skills_data/` and
installs every directory that contains a SKILL.md. The hardcoded LEGACY_PACK
below stays as a safety net so older wheels (or empty test environments)
still install the original two skills.
