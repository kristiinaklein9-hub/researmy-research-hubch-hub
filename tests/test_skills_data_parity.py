"""Parity test: `skills/` (source-of-truth) ↔ `src/research_hub/skills_data/`
(installer mirror).

The installer (``research_hub.skill_installer``) copies skills out of
``src/research_hub/skills_data/``, not out of ``skills/``. Editing a
SKILL.md in ``skills/`` but forgetting the mirror means the change
ships to readers of the public repo but never reaches users who run
``research-hub install``.

This test catches the divergence at PR time instead of at user-report
time. Phase 7 Wave A surfaced the gap (the anti-leakage rule and
backup callout edits landed in ``skills/`` but not in ``skills_data/``
until the code-reviewer subagent flagged it).

If you intentionally need to ship a skill only via the marketplace
(not via ``research-hub install``), add the skill name to
``SHADOW_ONLY_IN_SKILLS_TREE`` below with a one-line comment. The
set is currently empty — Phase 7 Wave C removed the vendored
``zotero-skills`` copy in favor of the canonical standalone plugin
at ``WenyuChiou/zotero-skills``.
