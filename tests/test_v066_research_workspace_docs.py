    two files are byte-identical (md5 matches; git stores 4863 identical
    bytes for both paths). The two GitHub Actions runs for the same commit
    produced opposite verdicts. Most likely an editable-install side effect
    rewrites one path with platform-native line endings even though both
    sources are LF in git.

    Normalize the comparison so the test asserts content equality, not
    line-ending equality. Drift in actual content (a real divergence we
    care about) still fails. Drift in only line endings (CI-environment
    artifact we don't care about) no longer flakes.
