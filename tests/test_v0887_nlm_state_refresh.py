"""v0.88.7 / v1.0.0 — NotebookLMClient session durability.

v0.88.7 root cause: Google rotates short-lived auth tokens (SIDCC /
SIDTS / OSID / CSRF) each session, but research-hub never wrote them
back to state.json.

v1.0.0 Fix-1: ``keepalive_sec`` kwarg wires the upstream background
cookie-rotation loop for long upload/download sessions.

v1.0.0 Fix-3: The old research-hub ``_save_state()`` in ``close()``
was redundant AND racy — it bypassed the upstream ``threading.Lock``
serialisation. It is removed; ``close()`` now delegates to upstream
``__aexit__`` which always persists the live jar race-free via
``ClientCore.close() → save_cookies()``.

These tests verify the wiring without spinning up a real Google session.
